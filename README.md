# ARP-Spoofing-MITM-Packet-Analysis-Lab-
A "Swiss Army knife" lab for ARP Poisoning and MITM attacks in an isolated VMware environment. This project uses Bettercap for reconnaissance and active spoofing, with Wireshark for deep packet analysis. Validated with "before and after" ARP evidence to prove successful traffic interception.
